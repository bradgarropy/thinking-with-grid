                <p>
                    CSS Grid revolutionizes how we create layouts on the web—but
                    how exactly should we use it? When someone emails you a PDF,
                    how do you know the best way to get started? Where should
                    you use which code? How do you translate a static drawing
                    into a dynamic layout? Having no idea what she’s about to
                    do, Jen Simmons will live code a design from start to finish
                    (or however close to finish she gets before time’s up). No
                    net, no preparation. How does someone in the real world
                    create a layout using the tools of Intrinsic Web Design?
